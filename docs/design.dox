/// \brief Flashback Program Design Decisions
/// \tableofcontents
///
/// Design decisions of this program is first written here for convinience of
/// developers who are eager enough to implement this program in other platforms,
/// languages, or even different implementations, and as a reference for future use.\n
/// You should follow through the sections to see all different aspects of the
/// deign.
///
///
/// \section definitions Definitions
///
/// There are several definitions you will encounter while reading the design
/// decisions of this program.\n
/// Of many definitions, a few are not used in a programatic sense. Hence,
/// they will not appear in the code, but they will be used to point to abstract
/// definitions or real entities but unrelated to the design of program itself.\n
/// The rest of definitions will be directly used to point out different aspects
/// of the program.
///
/// \subsection program_lifetime Program Lifetime
///
/// There are two definitions in the program lifetime:
///
/// - \ref session_definition
/// - \ref progress_definition
///
/// These definitions are only related to the program itself.
///
/// \subsubsection session_definition Session
///
/// A session is the time duration in which user actively interacts with practices.\n
/// This time span is not necessarily as long as the whole life time of the program itself.
///
/// @startuml
/// !theme cyborg
/// concise "Program" as p
/// concise "User" as u
/// robust "Session" as s

/// @u
/// 0 is Idle
/// 5 is Practicing
/// 30 is Idle

/// @s
/// 0 is Inactive
/// 5 is Active
/// 30 is Inactive
/// 35 is Inactive
/// @enduml
///
/// \subsubsection progress_definition Progress
/// 
/// Progress is all the information gathered from user activity during sessions
/// stored in a non-volatile memory.\n
/// Progress can be restored and used later after a new session starts.
///
/// @startuml
/// start
/// :Restore previous progress;
/// :User interacts;
/// :Save progress;
/// end
/// @enduml
///
/// Each time the progress is saved, the session information should be recorded
/// on non-volatile memory.\n
/// The information required from each session is:
///
/// - How long did the session took to finish?
/// - How many notes or practices has user done?
/// - What was the last note or practice that user see?
///
/// \subsection program_structure Program Structure
///
/// The program consists of two components:
///
/// - \ref registry_definition
/// - \ref recollection_definition
///
/// Each of these components can be used based on user decision.\n
/// The definition of these components are as follows:
///
/// \subsection registry_definition Registry Component
///
/// Registry is a place where user can find resources, and to step through the notes
/// taken from those resources, in order to review the subject represented by
/// that resource.\n
///
/// @startuml
/// !theme cyborg
/// left to right direction
/// :Client: as c
/// (Registry Component) as g
/// (Recollection Component) as r
/// note "Review previous chapters\nof a book" as n
/// c --> g
/// c --> r
/// g .. n
/// @enduml
///
/// For example, a user might want to find the book *Introduction to Linear Algebra*
/// authored by *Nathaniel Johnston*, and then review notes of the first 5 chapters
/// in order to step forward and read the 6th chapter.
///
/// The \ref registry_interface consists of two objects:
///
/// - \ref resource_definition
/// - \ref note_definition
///
/// \subsubsection resource_definition Resource
///
/// Resource is an object that contains technical information outside the scope of
/// the program, and is usually what practices are refering to.
/// A resource can be a book, website, video, course or any technically valuable piece
/// of data worth learning.
///
/// Each resource contains many \ref note_definition.
///
/// @startuml

///     position => chapter 2
/// }

/// @enduml
///
/// \subsubsection note_definition Note
///
/// Notes are text samples taken from resources, and they are strongly
/// resource dependent.\n
/// Meaning that notes are predicative texts directly picked from resources, and
/// only have educational values, but later will be used to create
/// \ref practice_definition objects in a question and answer form.
///
/// \subsection recollection_definition Recollection Component
///
/// On the other hand, the \ref recollection_definition is where user can practice
/// by being asked questions about the topics of a specific subject, and compare their
/// answers.\n
/// This is regardless of what resources are available to this subject.
///
/// @startuml
/// !theme cyborg

/// (Recollection Component) as r

/// r .. n
/// @enduml
///
/// For example, a user has already read the book *Introduction to Linear Algebra*,
/// and wants to practice the subject **Linear Algebra**, disregarding available
/// books covering this subject.\n
/// Here, user enters the \ref recollection_definition, the program lists a series
/// of questions, minimally picked to be practiced on the shortest time duration
/// possible, short enough to give user at least one question for each topic in the
/// subject.
///
/// The \ref recollection_interface consists of following objects:
///
/// - \ref subject_definition
/// - \ref topic_definition
/// - \ref practice_definition
